# Complex your sentence - V-2.0 

[link to project](https://iszhiyang.com/atoz/week2/)

Welcome to Complex your sentence - V-2.0! In this new version, I've added some fun, interactive features: 

- **Hover to Highlight Changes**
One of the biggest changes is the new hover-to-highlight feature. Now, when you hover over a word in the original sentence or the updated version, both will light up in matching colors. This makes it easy to see exactly what’s been transformed.

How it works: As you glide your mouse over the sentence, the words pop with a color that shows you what changed. So, when you hover over “course,” for example, you’ll instantly see its new, more complex definition like "a series of lessons" lit up in the updated sentence.
